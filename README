What is pyify?
--------------

Pyify is a command-line, recursive audio transcoding tool that is convenient
for mass conversion of music for portable audio devices or CD archival. I
wrote a Perl version several years ago that, though eventually robust, heavily
depended on the use of regular expressions, Perl hacks, and the code was
more or less hard to read.

But what does it do anyway?

- Conversion between popular formats: FLAC, WAV, Ogg, and MP3 while preserving
  metadata, while applicable
- Recurses into directories and preserves directory structure at the
  destination path
- Copies album art into destination
- Can be extended with additional format plugins

The actual conversions are done by the command-line decoders and encoders
for the respective formats. Pyify handles directory creation, metadata mapping,
and file renaming directly.

Pyify tries to mostly remain faithful to the output and command-line calling
convention of the original ify. It is eventually meant to surpass ify in
elegance and extensibility.
