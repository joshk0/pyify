What is pyify?
--------------

pyify is a command-line, recursive audio transcoding tool that is convenient
for mass conversion of music for portable audio devices or CD archival.

But what does it do anyway?

- Conversion between popular formats: FLAC, WAV, Ogg, and MP3 while preserving
  metadata, while applicable
- Recurses into directories and preserves directory structure at the
  destination path
- Copies album art into destination
- Can be extended with additional format plugins
- Can take advantage of multiple cores with a built-in jobserver.

The actual conversions are done by the command-line decoders and encoders
for the respective formats. Pyify handles directory creation, metadata mapping,
job management, and file renaming directly.

pyify tries to mostly remain faithful to the output and command-line calling
convention of the original ify, which was written in Perl. It is eventually
meant to surpass ify in elegance and extensibility.
